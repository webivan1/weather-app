- I should create .env file to keep a secret key

- I should think about the store
    - install all dependencies redux toolkit
    - I have a current weather in London and some weather for few days
        - I can use one state for weather or 2 states for current weather and list of weather for another days
        - If i have the same format of data, but i need in current time for current weather, i will create 2 states
        for current weather and forecast

- I have got a lot of variants weather for per day, how can i show a correct temp
    - I can filter times and choose optimal time, from 12 to 20pm
    - Or i should show a weather in this times only for next days
        - I will try the second variant

    I would like to make a slider of weather for per day with different times
        For example:
        - MON 12deg 00:00 clear
        - MON 18deg 09:00 clear
        - MON 21deg 13:00 cloudy
